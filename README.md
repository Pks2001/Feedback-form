Step 3: Obtain API Key

Generate API Key:

Look for an option to generate API keys.

Copy API Key:

Step 4: Integrate API Key into Server.js
Assuming you are using Node.js for your server-side code and have a Server.js file, here's how you can integrate the Frill.com API key:

Open Server.js in Your Code Editor:

Open the Server.js file in your preferred code editor.
Install Necessary Packages:

If you haven't already, install any necessary packages for handling HTTP requests. Common choices include axios or node-fetch.
bash
Copy code
npm install axios
Add API Key:

In your Server.js file, locate the section where you make requests to the Frill.com API.
Add the API key to the request headers.
javascript
Copy code
const axios = require('axios');

const frillApiKey = 'YOUR_FRILL_API_KEY';

// Example API request
axios({
  method: 'get',
  url: 'https://api.frill.com/endpoint',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${frillApiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
})
.then(response => {
  // Handle the API response
  console.log(response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
  // Handle errors
  console.error(error);
});
Replace 'YOUR_FRILL_API_KEY' with the actual API key you obtained from the Frill.com developer portal.

Save and Test:

Save your Server.js file.
Test your application to ensure that it can successfully make requests to the Frill.com API using the integrated API key.
